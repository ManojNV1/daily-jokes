Daily Joke Fetch: The GitHub Action runs every day, uses the Python script to fetch a random joke from JokeAPI.

Auto-Commit: The script updates your README.md, and the Action commits the change automatically.

Engaging Profile: Visitors see a fresh joke daily, making your profile memorable.

Zero Maintenance: Fully automated with GitHub Actions.

Easy to Customize: Add more APIs (quotes, weather, etc.) or change the design.
